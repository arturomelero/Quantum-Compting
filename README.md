# Quantum Computing

This repository contains solutions and projects related to Quantum Computing, based on two courses offered at the Complutense University of Madrid (UCM). The material provided is based on the course APCC, taught by Guillermo Botella (APCC), and builds upon concepts covered in the Quantum Computation (CC) course, by Sofyan Iblisdir.

## Course Structure

### [Practices](/Pr√°cticas)
The course includes four main practices, each designed to cover key concepts in quantum computing:

- Practice 1: Entanglement. This practice explores the fundamental concept of quantum entanglement.
- Practice 2: Quantum Teleportation and Superdense Coding. This practice covers the protocols for quantum teleportation and superdense coding.
- Practice 3: Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) and Draper Adder. This practice involves the implementation of QFT and the Draper adder circuit.
- Practice 4: Deutsch and Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithms. This practice focuses on the Deutsch and Deutsch-Jozsa algorithms, showcasing the power of quantum computation over classical methods.

### Project
- [Lattice-Based Cryptography (LBC)](/Proyecto%20(LBC)): A comprehensive project that introduces the essential aspects of lattice-based cryptography, providing a basic foundation for undergraduate students.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Qiskit**: The primary framework used for the practices, with real connections to IBM's quantum backends.
- **Cirq**: Employed as a supplementary tool for testing and experimentation.
- **tket**: Used to explore alternative quantum programming approaches.
- **QDK**: Microsoft Quantum Development Kit, tested as part of the practical exercises.
